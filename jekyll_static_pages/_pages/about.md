I got acquainted to Data Science as a career choice during 
Junior year of my bachelors after being exposed to Matlab. 
My curiosity for knowledge led me to learn R and eventually Python. 
My strong foundation in Mathematics (thanks to my Bachelors in 
Engineering degree) supported my career choice. 
I soon landed an internship as a Data Science Intern at a fintech 
startup Tino IQ. This opportunity focused mainly on Data Collection, 
Preprocessing and Analysis for algorithmic trading. Being my first 
formal footstep in the field, I gained immense knowledge in 
the Financial Technology domain.
I decided to pursue my Master's in Computer Science to further 
develop my foundational skills in programming
and to specialize in the field of Data Science. 
The many undergraduate courses taken at California State University 
Fullerton (CSUF) before starting with my graduate courses has instilled 
confidence in Data Structures, Algorithms and Programming. The numerous 
academic & personal <a href="/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> 
and research performed during my five semesters at CSUF has 
supported my growth in the field. While pursuing my Masters', I 
landed a golden opportunity at ASML as a Data Analytics & Visualization
Intern in Summer 2019. This opportunity allowed me to network and chat 
with some of the best minds in the company and the Silicon industry. 
My work involved performing Failure Analysis on the complicated
EUV machines to forecast maintenance and hence reduce downtime. 
I have always engaged myself in Continuous Learning to stay updated 
professionally and personally evident from the 
<a href="/certs" target="_blank">courses</a> I have completed. 
I also believe that Data Science does not just require Programming and/or Statistics Skills
but also the knowledge of the domain on which it is applied for. Hence, I 
have always strived to become a Generalist and not a Specialist.
