Here's some basic test

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** test.

What about a [link(https://github.com)]

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python Code Block:
```python
  import numpy as np

  def test_function(x, y):
    z = np.sum(x, y)
    return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/data_art.png" alt="some image">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/data_art.png)

Here's some math:
$$4z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$

Here's a comment:
{::comment}
This text is completely ignored by kramdown - a comment in the text.
{:/comment}

Do you see {::comment}this text{:/comment}?
{::comment}some other comment{:/}
