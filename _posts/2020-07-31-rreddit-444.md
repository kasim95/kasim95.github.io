This Project involved building a Reddit reader website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The name **Rreddit 444**
was influenced from the Linux command *chmod* where the argument 444 denotes a read only file.
The Project started as a hands-on experience with React.js library for Frontend Web Development
but soon converted into a full stack project with login backend created using Node.js Express and 
MongoDB Atlas service used for the MongoDB NoSQL database.
The content for the website is retrieved using the Reddit API.
To make the User Interface intuitive, this project uses CSS Bootstrap 4. 
The state on frontend is managed using Redux store which made it 
easier to manage data consistency between React components.

Below are some screenshots of the website:

The Website can also be viewed using the link in the Demo Section at the bottom of this page.

<b>Usage</b>

The Navigation bar contains four buttons named *Best*, *Hot*, *New*, and *Top*
used to filter Reddit posts. The *r/* button next to the filter buttons is
used to control Subreddit name to view posts for and the number of posts.
On the right side of navigation bar, the *Register* and *Login* buttons
can be used to register a new user and login page for the user respectively.
The body of the webpage contains posts contained in boxes. The post also shows
any media if available including images, gifs and videos. At the 
bottom right corner of each post, the 
comment icon can be used to toggle comments.
